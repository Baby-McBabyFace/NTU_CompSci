# CZ2005 - Operating Systems (OS)
This contains the code, documentations and explanation for CZ2005<br>
Added most of the logs and explanation because I'm frustrated with the lack of one online

## TL;DR
- Code has been added with many printf statements along the way to help with visualising how NachOS work
- I have attached logs and PDF (and Google Sheets) to explain what is happening at each tick

## Logs and Explanation

### Logs (Only for Exercise 2)
- Can be found in `lab2/adrian_logs` in the `.txt` file format 
- These logs are the actual logs exported from the console
- Added for the functions `TestValueOne` and `TestConsistency`
- No logs added for `TestValueMinusOne` as it is very similar to `TestValueOne`

### Explaining the logs and what is happening at each tick (PDF)
- Can be found in `lab2/adrian_logs` in the `.pdf` file format 
- Refer to the respective logs for reference
- For `TestConsistency()`, the processes are broken into pieces and colour coded to improve readability

## Acknowledgments
- Shout out to my buddy https://github.com/SoulXHades - a fair bit of code is copied done by him
- The lack of online guide/documentation by anyone
