## CZ2003 COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND VISUALISATION

### Disclaimer
- Follow my code and reports at your own risk as I don't know much about anything for this module.
- It is because I didn't go for a single lecture, tutorial (yes, I know it's graded)
- I got lucky and managed to <b>S/U</b> this core module due to the COVID-19 semester.
- Lab5 was also missing because it's not required (again due to the COVID-19 situation)
